Explain gravity to me in 50 words
ASSISTANT
Gravity is a fundamental force that attracts objects with mass towards each other. It gives weight to objects on Earth and influences the movement of celestial bodies. It operates on a scale from the atomic level to cosmic scales, keeping planets in orbit and enabling the formation of galaxies.
USER
I dont understand
ASSISTANT
Gravity is a natural force that pulls things towards one another. It keeps us on the ground and makes objects fall when we drop them. It also controls the movement of planets and stars in space. It's like a invisible force that holds everything together.
USER
that didnt help
ASSISTANT
Gravity is a force that exists between any two objects with mass. It pulls objects towards each other, causing them to have weight and fall towards the ground. The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them. It keeps planets in orbit and shapes the structure of the universe.
USER
explain like i am 5
ASSISTANT
Gravity is the reason why things fall down instead of floating away. It's like a special glue that pulls everything towards each other. It keeps us on the ground and makes sure that the Earth and other planets stay in their place. It's a force that is always there, even if we can't see it!",9,8,10,8,8,8.6

what is the difference between git and github in 50 words
ASSISTANT
Git is a distributed version control system designed for tracking changes in source code during software development. GitHub is a web-based hosting service that allows developers to store their Git repositories online, collaborate with others, and manage project workflows.
USER
why would you need git
ASSISTANT
Git is useful for several reasons. 

1. Version Control: Git enables you to track changes in your codebase, maintaining a complete history of revisions. This helps you identify bugs, revert to previous working versions, or merge code from multiple contributors.

2. Collaboration: Git allows developers to work simultaneously on the same project without conflicts. It provides tools for merging changes and resolving conflicts, making it easy to collaborate with remote team members.

3. Branching and Experimentation: Git makes it simple to create branches, allowing you to work on new features or experimental changes without affecting the main codebase. This fosters a more flexible and agile development workflow.

4. Backup and Recovery: With Git, your codebase is stored locally as well as remotely, providing a reliable backup in case of data loss or system failures. It ensures your work is safe and recoverable.

5. Open Source Contribution: Git is widely used in open-source projects, enabling developers worldwide to contribute and share their work seamlessly. It facilitates collaboration within the open-source community, driving innovation and growth.
USER
i dont understand
ASSISTANT
Git is a tool that helps developers keep track of changes made to their code and collaborate with others. It provides features like version control, allowing developers to easily revert to previous versions, work on new features separately, and merge code changes from different sources. GitHub is a web-based platform where developers can host their Git repositories, making it easier to collaborate with others, manage projects, and access additional tools and features.

summarize this for me in french:
Don’t tell me the cat ate your math sheet,
And your spelling words went down the drain,
And you couldn’t decipher your homework,
Because it was soaked in the rain.

Don’t tell me you slaved for hours
On the project that’s due today,
And you would have had it finished
If your snake hadn’t run away.

Don’t tell me you lost your eraser,
And your worksheets and pencils, too,
And your papers are stuck together
With a great big glob of glue.

I’m tired of all your excuses;
They are really a terrible bore.
Besides, I forgot my own work,
At home in my study drawer.

Ne me dis pas que le chat a mangé ta feuille de mathématiques,
Et que tes mots d'orthographe sont partis dans l'évacuation,
Et que tu ne pouvais pas déchiffrer tes devoirs,
Parce qu'ils étaient trempés sous la pluie.

Ne me dis pas que tu as travaillé pendant des heures
Sur le projet qui est dû aujourd'hui,
Et que tu l'aurais fini
Si ton serpent n'était pas parti en courant.

Ne me dis pas que tu as perdu ta gomme,
Et tes feuilles et crayons aussi,
Et que tes papiers sont collés ensemble
Avec une grosse tâche de colle.

Je suis fatigué de toutes tes excuses ;
Elles sont vraiment ennuyeuses à mourir.
En plus, j'ai oublié mes propres devoirs,

what potato to use for roasted potatoes?
ASSISTANT
For roasted potatoes, I recommend using varieties that have a higher starch content and a lower moisture content. This helps them achieve a crispy exterior while maintaining a fluffy interior. Some good options include:

1. Russet Potatoes: These are the classic choice for roasted potatoes. They have a high starch content and a dry texture, making them perfect for achieving a crispy exterior.

2. Yukon Gold Potatoes: These have a buttery and creamy texture, which works well for roasted potatoes. They have a slightly lower starch content compared to Russet potatoes but still yield excellent results.

3. Fingerling Potatoes: These small and elongated potatoes are known for their buttery flavor and firm texture. They roast well and develop a crispy exterior while staying tender inside.

Regardless of the type of potato you choose, make sure to cut them into similar-sized pieces to ensure even cooking. Enjoy your roasted potatoes!
